# Graduate Credit Assignment
#### Joe Bockskopf
CSCI E-31, Spring 2018
## Project Goals
The project demonstrates adding dates to a basic contact list application. This repository represents the *starting* state of the application. The goals for the assignment are to make these changes to the contact list app:
- Add a date (birth day) to the input form and the contact list
- Use [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to format the dates shown on the page
- Retrieve the contacts from the database so that they are sorted by the contact's birth month and day
- Enhance the contact list to highlight upcoming birthdays
